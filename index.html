            <h5>About Me:</h5>
            <p>
                My D.O.B is 7th January 2002.
                I was born in Cape Town South Africa and it is where I reside.
                I am currently studying coding at Life Choices Academy. I am trying to pursue a career in coding in order to reach my own aspirations and reply to those who believe in my self-worth by achieving results and creating a platform from where I will be able to create a better future for myself.
                I am an active person and enjoy the outdoors, I play soccer for a club.
                I like plaing video games, watching movies, series with and watching anime or reading manga in my free time.
                This is my first time experiencing coding and the atmosphere that comes with learning coding among peers and classmates, I hope to continue learning more from this course and from those around me in the future.
            </p>
            <h5>Skills:</h5>
            <p>
                I am creative, I enjoy learning with a passion, I can work with others and alone, I believe I have good stamina so I think that I'll be able to work long hours, I am punctual and do not like being late for appointments or commitments. 
            </p>
            <h5>Testimonials:</h5>
            <p>None of my previous work collegues are available to submit a testimonial on my behalf.</p>
